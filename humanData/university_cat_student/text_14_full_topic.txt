CATS asks students to provide feedback on teaching behaviors known to engage the adult learner , provide individual attention to students in a learner-centered manner , provide career-relevant learning opportunities and to organize and schedule course content to enhance learning in accelerated course formats . CATS student feedback provides faculty with suggested actions that they can take on the Pathways to Instructional Excellence professional development program to continuously sharpen their instructional skills and techniques . CATS is administered to students in all course formats ( F2F , OL , and HYB ) during the last two weeks of their course via the EvaluationKIT survey platform .
