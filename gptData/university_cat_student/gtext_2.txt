After analyzing that word list, I immediately ran a test against the Psalms corpus to see how well it would rhyme those words. Here's a snippet:

Then looked upon Psalm and upon PsalmThirdAnd saw the inability of this piece to come anywhere close,This verse spoke to himAnd the Psalmist then respondedAnd said,Slack attempt! That one will never do.

The approach I decided to take for this third rhyme bucket concerned a set of Wordnik search queries. Here, I simply adapt the previous two examples, changing the search words, and rewording them to make more sense in the context. So, I did a search on Psalms and Creative Commons.

This one also came back as a failure:

And patient patience will also waitUntil things are done to break down the weight.

To be sure, I'm finding these rhymes fast and easy to make, but there's no rule that says you have to be happy with the results. I gave the Quinetodeae hymn a once-over, and if I had to guess, I'd rank it a solid thirty-two on our 'lin.' That's an improvement over the Ophiocistax hymn, that at least passes an implicit check, one that seems to allow rhymes like "hone" and "don't." Onward, therefore, for the factoid consolation that the more difficult examers are the easiest to make.

This one has a much more sensible sounding rhyme:

Then overcame the stiffness of the Psalm's refusal to provide fun rhymesFor it is necessary that the words must provide comfort and amusementAnd evince beauty in these words so enjoyed.

But that's nothing compared to a likely source of inspiration for a proposed new hymn:

And next he moved on to Psalms and sentriesAnd quickly found a digital reflection of celestial symphonies.

So it seems that Wordnik has begun to catch on to the algorithm, but it also appears that it still hasn't gotten around to breaking it or even substantially attenuating it, since I don't see a great deal of hand curation here. Mostly, it's automated targeting and WordPress filters doing the work Peter explains above:

Pros

- They're choosing source materials that don't have many repetitions
- Their algorithms are finding meaningful connections between English words and Biblical verses
- The end result paragraphs are fun and entertaining

Cons

- They seem to offer no official explanation of the choices they
