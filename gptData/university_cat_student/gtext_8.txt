Essays

First, separate essays into parts. We will discuss only the parts that you should deal with to write a perfect answer (This does not apply to all TOEFL essays; for each question we have to analyse):

- Topic paragraph: demonstrate your topic knowledge and basically restate the question
- Supporting paragraphs: first sentence is your topic sentence and the second and third sentences explain each other; your job is to develop a relation between these sentences and end by reiterating your topic sentence in conjunction with the main idea of the paragraph or perhaps a sentence with your own opinion;(see Fig 3. 4)
- Conclusion: reflect on what you have just written (see Fig 3. 4)
- Use everyday language: Be comfortable with organizing your writing so that it fits into the three- five paragraph structure with clear and coherent paragraphs. Show essay-writing knowledge and employ the graphic organizer structure with your own words. Use everyday language such as pronouns (I, we,…), tenses, possessives and adjectives and try not to display your knowledge (i.e., vocabulary, and thus not to complicate the ring). Add your own opinion without any understatement and exageration but not showy language. Provide a conclusion which provides a sense of closure for the reader.

In and out: in paragraphs summarize what is relevant to that topic. Write your sentences in a logical order. Use transitional words such as first, second, next, finally, to summarize/to sum up, also, then, likewise, and so.

Sentence outline: use strong topic sentences and make sure you continue to reflect on that topic sentence throughout the sentences of each paragraph a the end stating the overall (you agree or disagree) point of view. In a conclusion, detail again what you have just written. Follow this basic style of parallel construction when writing your essays

Map: use the writer’s map to help you understand what is going on in your writing. Two main maps are: Writing an Essay and Writing about a Topic. You will receive a separate sheet showing these maps. Let’s take an overview of structures:
