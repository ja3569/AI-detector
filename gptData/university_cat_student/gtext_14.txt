6. Watch the movie

Let’s talk about watching movies in college for a second. While it is easy to start studying, it is just as easy to procrastinate and fall back on binge-watching, TV-shows, and movies.

It is crucial to keep movie-watching break short( not check out “Top 10 Romantic Movies for Wednesday” kind of short, please).

An hour of break between two-hour study session will help you to study well and more efficiently. Not only will it keep you motivated to study but also will keep you stress-free. Add fun to your routine to prevent it from becoming tedious for you. Be creative and add the motivational playlist, preferably youtube as mentioned above.

Don’t study when you are in a bad mood.

7. Party

And finally, as some crazy night, you postpone your own guilty study session to check out the new party places. College life has to be the most exciting, and the most interesting part of your life might be this phase.

So, take the most advantage of this hell duration and enjoy well. Yeah, we know that those late night studying sessions and those early morning coffee screaming sessions in the library can be really stressful but, do not forget to have some fun during this time.

You are here to explore yourself during that time, whenever you find the time, take break and find out something which you want to, as that will help you to balance things out.
