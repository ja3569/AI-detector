, global warming, the laundry, and the walk to campus.”

The diary follows in chronological order. Notebooks are filed in chron order, as well, but since I have been at writing more serious about keeping a diary I "review" previous weeks and month to see what events I missed. Works extremely well. I write all that goes on with my “lists.”

I use a double entry, weekly logging log, per touted by Noah Childs over at http://www.thennotan.wordpress.com/. This has a blank index card that I file in the notebook intended for that week. It can be “blanks” or events, just depends. It MUST be a short and easy to carry. I also every week have a personal summary and “spotlight” the week’s entries that would more suited for public (could be a need of satisfaction or just bit my tongue”.

Of course, there are duplicates in the notebook and a standard, if incomplete weekly summaries. Also, daily inspiration, ideas, work shifts.

Now, this is “a lot,” but I have found it really works best for me to get down (or pretty close) to what I want. I never used a cahier until recently; now a simple “bullet” system, but find I have more things to remember so I went back to cahiers.

The one huge issue with my system is when you “throw” something in at the last minute, if you are not careful, or take the time to fill in an index card, it will be difﬁcult to ﬁnd that point. Additionally, it is diﬃcult to remember to ﬁll in some parts of the diary. That, and then your diaries start to form massive, informal, archives. It is diﬃcult to catalogue them and there is still that ﬁling issue. I am always looking for solutions to this. This is why an oﬀ center system may work depending on how it is done.

So, my present solution:

1)
I use a three-ring binder. You may think a three ring binder is a little inﬂexible, and it may be more of a break away from the traditional diaries, but again it all depends on the outcome you are seeking. My journals are thick. If there is travel they get thicker. I like travel stuff with my journals so ﬁling in neatly contract cards works well. Again,
