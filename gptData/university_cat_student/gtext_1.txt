stuations, going abroad to do exchange year or maybe write about your favourite tv-show you watch every Tuesday with your friends.

It can be hard for some people to find something they are interested in, but if you just think about it, you will find something to write about. Maybe you think you haven’t got any topics at all only the same old things you write about. But trust me there is always something else you can write about, or thoughts that you haven’t written down yet.

Don’t compare yourself to others. This tip is the most important one. Do not compare yourself to others, you can’t change yourself for someone else. Besides comparing you only way you sure about is how other people is living, it doesn’t mean that is happy. Don’t think about how your other classmates are doing, think about how well you are doing, than you will learn to improve your skills.

Do not be judgemental of others in terms of ratings, words or acceptance. Comparing yourself to someone else requires judgement of yourself, so it’s just toxic on your own person. I never heard of you can be to focus on yourself. If you compare yourself to someone you don’t know of they aren’t happy or have problems either, and maybe you feel off in your own environment because you are unhappy with that other person, that then probably means that you are not yourself or don’t really want to be on that place you’re at circuit.

As I said you don’t know anything about the person you’re looking at so don’t make assumptions. Just be nice and take people as how you meet them and not on the smallest details that are just normal for that person. Since all people are different and people only accept people that are pretty much like themselves. If you at least are kind to others, you will be more likely to find friends and people accept you much quicker.

Only write for you and not for the others. I know people who read every word of everything i post and write almost all my followers. But when I reach the 100.000 readers point this isn’t what you write about yourself for others to find you on the next year, instead you should write for yourself. Not everyone reads it, but the people that get to meet you, they just genuinely love you for who you are. So don’t write what other want you to write or for other just to be content, the message gets lost and the person you are trying to please was never you
