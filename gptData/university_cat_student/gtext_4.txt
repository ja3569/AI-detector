Do it in your own words, do it in your own handwriting.

This is the only way to complete exams.

And we are standing strong in this month of July and August.

Almost all the states of India are opening for exams, they are preparing for exams.

Mobile games, online games, internet games, they are very popular, trendy, tech, they are all like that. But they are going back. When they are sent for exams, the first text comes, "Why don't you give text here?" It is not a result, it is a satisfaction of cost. They are enjoying a tourist, they are not paying for it. They are enjoying a good show. But while we are miserable, in the exam, in the school,
